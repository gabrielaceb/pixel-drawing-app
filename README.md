# Pixel Drawing App

A drawing application built with Python and Pygame. The app allows users to draw using different brush shapes and sizes, extract colour palettes from images, and create pixel-style artwork.

## Features

- Multiple brush shapes: square, circle, diamond
- Adjustable brush sizes
- Dynamic colour palette extraction from images
- Drag & drop image support 
- Save artwork as PNG

## How It Works

1. Users draw directly on the canvas using the selected brush and colour.
2. An image can be dragged onto the window to extract a colour palette.
3. The palette is generated by analysing the most frequent colours in the image.
4. Colours can be selected from the palette and used immediately for drawing.
5. The final artwork can be saved as a PNG file.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- pygame
- Pillow
